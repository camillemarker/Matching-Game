#### **_Description_**

This is a card-matching memory game that I will make using the vanilla Javascript tools which I learned in my first two weeks of coding bootcamp. After an instructions page, players will be redirected to a gameboard (card grid) with a timer. Timer will begin count down immediately upon clicking 'Begin Game' button on the previous instructions page. Players will be able to select cards within a grid of cards to turn them over, revealing an image on the back of the card. Players will then try to find the cards match. Once matched, both cards will disappear from the grid. Players will have X minutes to find all matching pairs in the grid before a timer runs out and declares a win/lose depending on whether or not all pairs have been matched. Player will then have the option to click a play again button and restart the game deck/timer.
