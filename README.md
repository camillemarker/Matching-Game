#### **_Description_**

This is a card-matching memory game that I made using the vanilla Javascript tools which I learned in my first two weeks of coding bootcamp. After an instructions page, players will be redirected to a gameboard (card grid) with a timer. Timer will begin count down immediately upon clicking 'Begin Game' button on the previous instructions page. Players will be able to select cards within a grid of cards to turn them over, revealing an image on the back of the card. Players will then try to find the cards match. Players will have X minutes to find all matching pairs in the grid before a timer runs out and declares a win/lose depending on whether or not all pairs have been matched. Player will then have the option to click a play again button and restart the game deck/timer.
