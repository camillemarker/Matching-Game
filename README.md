#### **_Description_**

This is a card-matching memory game that I made using the vanilla Javascript tools which I learned in my first two weeks of coding bootcamp. After an instructions page, the player will be redirected to a gameboard (card grid) with a timer. Timer will begin count down immediately upon clicking 'Begin Game' button on the previous instructions page. Player will be able to select cards within a grid of cards to turn them over, revealing an image on the back of the card. Player will then select a second card to try and find the cards match. If a match is found, the selected cards will remain image-side up and no longer have click functionality. If a match is not found, selected cards will flip back over. Player will have 40 seconds to find all matching pairs in the grid before a timer runs out and declares a loss. If all six pairs are matched before time is out, the clock will stop and winner will be declared. A play again button will then appear under the timer to restart the timer and shuffle the deck.
