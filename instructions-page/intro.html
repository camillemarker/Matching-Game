  <h1>Game Instructions</h1>
  <h2>Howdy cowgirls and cowboys! Welcome to the Wild West. Out here in no man's land, quick wits are just as important as your quick draw. In this standoff against the clock, select a card to reveal the image on the back. Once you have revealed a card, select another to find its match. If a match is found, both cards will dissapear from the game board. If a match is not found, both selected cards will flip back over. You have one minute to find all six matching pairs or you're out of the saddle! Your time starts once you press 'Begin'. Pull on your boots and pony up!  </h2>
